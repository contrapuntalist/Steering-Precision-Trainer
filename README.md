# Steering Precision Trainer

**Open the trainer:** https://contrapuntalist.github.io/Steering-Precision-Trainer/

A free, browser-based steering precision/reaction trainer for sim racers and real drivers alike. This project is based on my original idea and training concept. I’m not a professional developer, so the code itself was generated with the help of AI, guided by my requirements, testing, and revisions. The goal was to create a practical steering precision trainer that fine tunes one's muscle memory - something I’ve felt has been missing from both sim racing and real-world driver training.
Works with **Simucube and most Direct Drive wheels** via the browser **Gamepad API**.

## How to use (30 seconds)
1. Plug in your wheel.
2. Open the trainer link above.
